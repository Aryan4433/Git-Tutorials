🎯 Project Launch: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using ANN 🧠💳

🚀 I'm excited to share my latest deep learning project:
📌 Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

🔍 In this project, I developed a robust fraud detection model leveraging deep learning to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions—even with the challenges of class imbalance.

✨ Key Highlights:

✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for enhanced model accuracy

🧠 ANN Model Development using Keras & TensorFlow frameworks

📊 Model Evaluation with Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for comprehensive performance insights

🔍 Insights & Observations after each step to ensure transparency and foster learning

🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning using Keras Tuner for optimal model performance

🚀 Model Deployment with Flask API for real-time fraud detection

👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies:
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Keras | TensorFlow | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Flask | REST API

📊 Outcome:
Achieved high precision and recall in detecting fraud—critical for real-world applications where class imbalance poses a significant challenge.

💡 This project demonstrates how deep learning can strengthen financial security by making fraud detection smarter and more reliable.
